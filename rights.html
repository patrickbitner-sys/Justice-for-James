          <h1>Know Your Rights</h1>
          <p>Below is general information about crime victim rights. Laws vary by jurisdiction and this information is not a substitute for legal advice. Consult with an attorney or victims’ advocate for guidance specific to your case.</p>

          <h2>Notification and Conferment</h2>
          <p>Victims and their immediate family members are generally entitled to timely notification of key court dates, plea negotiations and sentencing. In many jurisdictions, prosecutors must also confer with victims before agreeing to a plea bargain. If you aren’t receiving notice, politely document your requests and consider filing a complaint with the appropriate oversight agency.</p>
          <h2>Participation and Impact Statements</h2>
          <p>Families have the right to attend hearings and, at sentencing, present a victim impact statement describing how the crime has affected them. Participation is a powerful way to ensure your loved one’s story is heard.</p>
          <h2>Restitution and Support</h2>
          <p>You may be entitled to restitution for certain out‑of‑pocket expenses stemming from the crime. Resources such as counseling, support groups and compensation programs can also help with the financial and emotional toll. Local victim assistance offices can guide you through available services.</p>
          <h2>Filing a Complaint</h2>
          <p>If you believe your rights have been violated—such as being excluded from plea discussions or not receiving required notices—you can file a formal complaint. Keep records of all communications, mailings, tracking numbers and dates. Our documents section provides template letters and complaint forms that you can adapt.</p>
          <h2>Not Legal Advice</h2>
          <p>This page offers general information only and is not legal advice. Laws vary from state to state, and nothing here should be construed as forming an attorney‑client relationship.</p>
