# Letter to U.S. Attorney General – Request for Oversight

_Date: [Insert date]_

**To:** The Honorable [Name], United States Attorney General

Dear Attorney General [Last Name],

I am writing to you as the sibling of **James [Last Name]**, who was killed on [date of incident] in [city, state]. My family’s experience in the resulting criminal case has left us feeling invisible and powerless. Despite numerous requests, we have been excluded from plea negotiations and denied timely notice of critical hearings. These actions violate our rights under Colorado law and undermine the fundamental principles of justice.

After exhausting remedies at the state level, we respectfully request that the Department of Justice review this case and, if appropriate, exercise oversight to ensure that victims’ rights are protected. Our primary concerns include:

1. **Exclusion from plea negotiations:** Prosecutors reached a plea agreement with the defendant without conferring with us, depriving us of our right to provide input.
2. **Lack of transparency:** We received no advance notice of hearings and learned about plea deals only after they were finalized.
3. **Potential civil rights implications:** The failure to honor victims’ rights may reflect broader systemic issues that warrant federal attention.

Attached are copies of correspondence sent to the Colorado Attorney General, certified‑mail receipts, and a timeline of events. We have also filed a complaint under Colorado’s Victims Rights Act, but to date our concerns remain unresolved.

We ask that your office review these materials and advise whether there is a basis for federal involvement or guidance. Our goal is not only to seek justice for James but also to ensure that no other family endures similar exclusion.

Thank you for your consideration. We would appreciate confirmation of receipt and any information about next steps.

Respectfully,

[Your Name]
[Your relationship to the victim]
