# Letter to Colorado Attorney General – Request for Inclusion and Accountability

_Date: [Insert date]_

**To:** The Honorable [Name], Attorney General of Colorado

Dear Attorney General [Last Name],

I am writing to you regarding the criminal case arising from the death of my brother, **James [Last Name]**, which occurred on [date of incident] in [city/county]. Over the past several months my family and I have repeatedly asked to be informed and consulted about the prosecution of this case. Unfortunately, we have been denied notice of hearings and excluded from plea negotiations, in violation of the Colorado Victims Rights Act (VRA).

We respectfully request your intervention to ensure that the prosecution complies with all VRA requirements going forward. Specifically, we ask that the following measures be taken:

1. **Timely notice:** Provide us with advance notice of all hearings, plea discussions and sentencing dates.
2. **Conferment:** Confer with us before any plea agreement is reached so that we may share our views on proposed outcomes.
3. **Record correction:** Review the case to determine why notices were not sent and implement corrective action to prevent future violations.

Enclosed with this letter are copies of previous correspondence, certified‑mail receipts and a timeline detailing the points at which we sought information. We are also filing a formal VRA complaint with your office.

Our hope is to work collaboratively with your office to ensure accountability and to uphold the rights of crime victims and their families. Please confirm receipt of this letter and advise us on how to proceed.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your relationship to the victim]
