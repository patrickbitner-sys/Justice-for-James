# Cover Letter – Complaint re: Exclusion from Silva–Babcock Plea Negotiations

_Date: [Insert date]_

**To:** [Name], [Title], [Agency]

Dear [Recipient],

Enclosed please find my formal complaint under the Colorado Victims Rights Act regarding the handling of the plea negotiations in the *State v. [Defendant]* case (often referred to as the “Silva–Babcock” hearings). As described in the complaint, my family and I were not given notice of these negotiations and were excluded from conferring with the prosecution before a plea agreement was reached.

Our omission from this critical stage has been devastating. We learned after the fact that decisions were made without our input, contrary to the intent of the VRA. The attached complaint outlines the specific statutory provisions that we believe were violated and includes a timeline of communications demonstrating our repeated attempts to engage with the prosecution.

Please review the enclosed materials and investigate these concerns. We ask that you ensure future proceedings comply with victims’ rights and take corrective action where necessary. A return receipt from this mailing is attached for your records. If you require any additional information, please contact me using the details below.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
