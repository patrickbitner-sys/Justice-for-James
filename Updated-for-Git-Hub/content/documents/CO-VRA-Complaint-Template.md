**To:** [Name and title of VRA coordinator or authority]

**Subject:** Victims Rights Act complaint – Case [Case number]

Dear [Recipient],

I am writing to file a formal complaint under Colorado’s Victims Rights Act (VRA), C.R.S. § 24‑4.1‑301 et seq., concerning the handling of the criminal case arising from the death of my brother, **James [Last Name]**, on [date of incident].

As the next of kin, my family and I have the right to timely notice of critical proceedings and the opportunity to confer with prosecutors before significant decisions are made. However, throughout this case we have been excluded from plea negotiations, left without notice of hearings, and denied the ability to provide input. These omissions have compounded our grief and undermined our trust in the justice process.

Specifically, I allege the following violations:

1. **Failure to confer:** Prosecutors did not confer with me before engaging in plea negotiations pursuant to C.R.S. § 24‑4.1‑302.5(1)(a).
2. **Lack of notice:** I did not receive timely notice of the Silva–Babcock plea discussions or related hearings as required by C.R.S. § 24‑4.1‑302.5(1)(b).
3. **Exclusion from proceedings:** My family was not allowed to be present or heard during key hearings, which violates the right to be heard under C.R.S. § 24‑4.1‑302.5(1)(d).

Attached to this complaint are copies of relevant correspondence, certified‑mail receipts, and a timeline of our efforts to obtain inclusion. The timeline shows emails to the Colorado Attorney General requesting conferment, letters to the U.S. Attorney General seeking oversight, and the dates on which we learned of the plea negotiations after the fact.

**Relief requested:** I respectfully request that your office investigate these violations, ensure that all future proceedings include victim input, and provide written findings regarding this complaint. I also request any corrective action necessary to remedy the harm caused by the exclusion of my family.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and contact me if additional information is needed.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
