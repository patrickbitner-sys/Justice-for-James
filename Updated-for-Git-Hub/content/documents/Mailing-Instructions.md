# Mailing Instructions for Formal Letters and Complaints

Sending hard‑copy letters and complaints via a trackable service helps establish a clear record of your communications. Below are general instructions that Patrick has followed when mailing documents related to James’s case. Adjust these steps to suit your situation.

1. **Prepare your document:** Print the signed letter or complaint along with any exhibits or attachments. Make a scanned copy or photograph of each page for your records.
2. **Choose a trackable service:** Use USPS Certified Mail with Return Receipt, FedEx, UPS or another service that provides a tracking number and proof of delivery.
3. **Address the envelope:** Clearly write the recipient’s full name, title, agency and mailing address. Include your return address in the top‑left corner.
4. **Include supporting materials:** If you are sending evidence (e.g., certified‑mail receipts, prior correspondence), organize these materials behind your cover letter or complaint.
5. **Obtain a receipt:** At the post office or shipping counter, request a receipt showing the tracking number. Keep this slip as proof that you mailed the package.
6. **Request a return receipt (optional):** For USPS Certified Mail, you can purchase a green return‑receipt card or electronic return receipt. This card is signed by the recipient upon delivery and returned to you, confirming receipt.
7. **Update your records:** Once the package is delivered, note the delivery date and tracking number in your timeline or evidence index. Scan and save the signed return receipt if you receive one.
8. **Follow up:** If you do not receive confirmation of receipt within a reasonable time, contact the office by phone or email, providing the tracking number and asking for acknowledgment.

These steps provide a clear paper trail, which can be invaluable if you need to demonstrate that you exercised your rights under the law.
